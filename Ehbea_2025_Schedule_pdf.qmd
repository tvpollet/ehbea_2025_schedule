# Preconference: Collaboration at Scale: Behind the Scenes of Big Team Science 
 
**When**: Monday 14 April 2025, 2-3pm 

**Panellists**: 

- Dr Thora Bjornsdottir, ManyFaces
- Dr Shona Duguid, ManyPrimates
- Dr Harry Clelland, Multi100
- Dr Amanda Rotella, Behavioural Science Forecasting Collaborative

**Description**: 
This panel will explore the how of Big Team Science in research, highlighting the successes and challenges of coordinating large-scale collaborative projects. Panellists with diverse Big Team experiences will share experiences on what worked, what didn’t, and the lessons learned from managing diverse teams across institutions, disciplines, and time zones. Whether you’re participating in a big team project, considering being a collaborator, or want to coordinate your own multi-site project, this panel will offer insights on how to organise and navigate collaborative science.

# Plenaries

## Monday April 14th, 4-5 pm: Russell Hill (Durham University)

**"How STRANGE are your wild primates? Observer impacts on observational data collection"**

**Abstract**: The idea that many studies in disciplines such as cognitive science, behavioural economics, and psychology cannot be generalized because the participants were a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) and unrepresentative subset of the global population is now well recognised. Similar sampling problems also appear prevalent in studies of animal behaviour, however, where the individuals' sampled may not be fully representative of the wider populations: the study subjects may be STRANGE. I will largely focus on one potential bias and how observer presence may influence the data collected.   Observational studies of behaviour, particularly on primates, have relied on habituation, the process where wild animals learn to accept researchers as ‘neutral’ elements of their environment. Despite being highlighted in the STRANGE framework, however, this assumption of neutrality is rarely tested and the impacts of habituation are seldom explicitly acknowledged. Drawing on primate case studies from my field site in the Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa, alongside other published work, I explore how observer effects could be significant and undermine inferences and interpretations, even after years of observation.  Collectively, I will argue that complex interactions between observer presence and animal behaviour could challenge the robustness of many previous research findings.

**"Error, Inspiration, and the Dynamics of Variance in Cultural Transmission"**

**Abstract**: Cultural evolution still struggles with the formalization of information transmission. Despite drawing inspiration from biological inheritance, it has never achieved a rigorous parallel to Fisher's approximations, which enabled the development of population genetics and the modern synthesis. Memeticists jumped directly to particularization without considering how continuous and discrete descriptions of culture fit together.
In the biological domain, continuous traits have been reduced to discrete genetic alleles. We suggest that the cultural domain requires the opposite: reducing discrete behavioral manifestations to an underlying continuous space. This “positional” approach already has two predecessors in the literature: vector embeddings of discrete artifacts in “design spaces” and the idea of a continuous “culture space” underpinning differences and similarities between individuals.
We show how the continuous view can finally inspire variance decomposition in cultural transmission. The equivalents to biological mutation (unintended deviation from the weighted mean of “cultural parents”) and recombination and separation (constructive exploration of the space surrounding “parental” values) can both be identified. Through a series of empirical experiments, we demonstrate that both terms are expected to exhibit offspring variance proportional to parental variance. This renders most extensions of population genetics to culture misleading. Yet, it can explain why subcultures emerge easily while biological speciation is rare, why culture either changes abruptly or hardly at all, and why it is possible to identify a forged Plato dialogue through word frequency analysis but not through topics or characters.

## Tuesday April 15th, 1-2 pm: Lynda Boothroyd (Durham University)

**"Sexual selection, culture, and appearance ideals"**   

**Abstract**:
Appearance ideals are the physical and appearance-based traits that humans consider to be attractive or desirable in themselves and others. The emergence of Evolutionary Psychology was a major contributor to increasing academic research into appearance ideals, in the context of mate choice and sexual selection. Typically, however, conclusions were based on data predominantly from high-income, industrialised populations. In the current talk I outline how an early focus on universal preference adaptations gave way to a belief in conditional adaptations, and discuss how research from rural and non-industrialised populations challenges both these approaches. These more culturally diverse data, however, potentially point to more basic adaptations and learning processes which may help explain when cultures differ, and when they don’t, in their appearance ideals. I end with reflections on the contributions of participants’ own perspectives in appearance research.

## Wednesday April 16th, 9-10 am: Heidi Colleran (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig)

**"There is no such thing as 'natural fertility'"**

**Abstract**:
The idea of a naturalized state of human reproduction (‘natural fertility’) permeates evolutionary anthropology, demography and allied fields. In this talk I’ll provide an overview and a critique of this concept. I’ll argue that natural fertility creates unnecessary ethical, theoretical, measurement and conceptual problems. Putting pressure on this core assumption helps build bridges between disciplines and opens up new ways to approach reproductive diversity, now and in the past. Drawing on a combination of methods from primary anthropological fieldwork to computational modelling, I will argue that we should get rid of natural fertility. Instead, we should aim to better understand the feedback between culture, reproductive outcomes, and population trajectories.

## Thursday April 17th, 9-10 am: Christine Caldwell (University of Stirling)

**"Cognitive challenges in human cumulative cultural evolution"**

**Abstract**:
Human evolutionary success has been attributed to the capacity to accumulate knowledge and skills over generations via cultural transmission, but explanations for the distinctiveness of human culture remain heavily debated. Some accounts have proposed that human transmission processes may implicate cognitive capacities not available to other species, often proposing these capacities to be specialised adaptations. I will present a series of studies carried out within my research group, investigating relationships between cognitive development and behaviours associated with both acquiring and passing on social information. In most of our experimental work we have endeavoured to capture the kinds of challenges likely to be present in real world cases of cumulative cultural evolution in humans. We find that there are indeed significant cognitive challenges associated with effective accumulation of knowledge via social learning, illustrated by striking differences in performance between children from different age groups. However, the cognitive resources required may not be specific to cultural transmission, likely including general-purpose cognitive abilities as well as broader socio-cognitive skills used in other contexts such as communication, cooperation and competition. Therefore, although human cumulative culture may depend on distinctively human cognition, it should not be assumed that these abilities were selected specifically for this purpose.
